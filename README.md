# CS-TicTacToe

how does it work?

-once the board is displayed like in the next template:
-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------
  it'll ask you to pick your move, it will start with player "X", and then player "O" will be next.
-------------

  -game goes on until someone wins by conecting a full row, column or diagonal.
-------------

  -if the board gets full and no row, column or diagonall is connected by any of the players the game will end in a tie.
-------------
